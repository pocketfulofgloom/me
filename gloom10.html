IN PROGRESS

A dark figure writhed, danced, twisted, five dark and incoherent limbs waving in and out like five sickle moons. 
	I murmured, tried to roll over, but still it was there, now cast by a sunset so dark it was like a sky of blood tinged purple by dying melodies.
	Frustrated now, I rolled over a final time and stared into the coal dark eyes of–
“Gabe.”
Someone was shaking me– by the sharpness of the fingertips damned as ten fish hooks digging in I could tell it had to be Naomi.  
“Not right now, Naomi,” I groaned, “God, I had the most terrible dream…”
:”Gabe! I need you to…”
Murmuring, mumbling, incoherent trembling.
Sinking…
Sinking…
Sunk.
Darkness fluttered me into a memory:
 It was the early days of life at the house at 423 Montgomery St. Ren and Naomi chattered in the kitchen, Ren’s lovey-dovey, deer-in-headlights eyes gazing into hers soulfully. Naomi glanced around the room, looking anywhere but into Ren’s eyes as she talked.
	 I was pissed. I was always pissed with Ren in those days. I fidgeted with my glove, tore it on and off.  I wasn’t staring, but at some point I caught Naomi’s gaze and our eyes locked. She went quiet, then stumbled over a word, then her tongue meandered and brain caught the hook of her train of thought and continued fluidly, swinging her eyes to bore rigidly into Ren’s forehead.
	I took note of this with a sound of interest and eased ro my bedroom. I’d never interacted with Naomi. I knew Ren was utterly obsessed with her and that was about the extent of it. But now I was starting to understand why.
Through the next few days, whenever I saw her we’d lock gazes. One day as Ren and her were talking I became irritated, fidgeting with my glove, wandered up. Ignoring Ren, I smiled and reached out a hand. “Gabe. Nice to meet you.”
I realised my fingers were uncovered. I stared down in horror, corruption dancing, whirling, spinning. I bit my lip and stumbled off.  I could feel their eyes on me– Naomi’s concerned, Ren’s incised. I lurched to the bathroom and swung open the door wide. Panicked, sweat rolling down my skin, I slammed the bathroom door behind me, shuddered and nearly fell. That was fucking close. Way too close. I stared into the mirror, brushed my hair up in my hands and trembled. Tried to clean up but turned all things on and retched into the sink.
Way too goddamn close. I can’t slip up again. Not for Naomi, and not for any other reason. I swallowed down bile and vowed never to get close to Naomi again and–
A sea of dark stars swayed, swayed, curled their hips and rattled massive dark jaws open to—
“GABE!” Naomi shouted hoarsely in my ear.
	I cussed, shook my head, rolled over and slammed my head down. “Shut it,” I murfed incoherently into a pillow, shrank away from that harsh peeling cry, snuggled into a ball and shrank down, down, pressed my head into the fabric and–
“GABE! WAKE UP, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!” Naomi yelled and ripped sharp fingers into my arms. I was tugged roughly from my warm, comfortable darkness– 
She finally got me to stumble up. My world lurched up, split open into a blast of vicious light stabbing into my retinae. The sky was unnaturally, almost plastic teal, and the earth was a jarring pink. The sun was pale yellow-green, and wouldn't stop glaring into my eyes no matter how hard I squinted.  I blinked myself into consciousness, eyes burning harshly. I wasn’t in bed– god– I must’ve—
Pink and blue. 
I stared incredulously ahead. Must’ve what, Gabe, huh? Must’ve fucking what? 
“Naomi, what the fuck?” I muttered.
“Get up, Gabe,” Naomi spat vehemently and reached out a trembling sweating pale hand. I reached up and gripped tight, corruption curling into itself uncomfortably under each velvet cap and roiling tremendously like a million bugs at the rank of moisture as she ripped me to my feet. At this point I noticed for the first time the source of that uncomfortable pink. It was a sort of fuschia grass– no, it wasn’t quite grass- it was some other thing, a fungal growth, maybe— a carpet of indistinct fibres that reminded me of vines and lichen-moss.
	“How the fuck did we get here?” I murmured, and Naomi’s eyelid began to twitch.
“Your fault.”
“What?” I stared at her.
“You don’t remember?”
I laid down on the couch and frowned, eased still. As my body began to sink into the crack between the cushions, the frill of my glove hitched on some sharp fibre and corruption in my palm coiled free. 
As I rolled over, I fell from the cushions and my corruption licked against the couch fibres, flicked green distortion like pixels stabbing through the cushion and commanded it to change, change. The couch fibres whirled, twirled, whipped drastically, dragged at the room. The whole ceiling began to swirl as the colours sucked from the walls and furniture as a blanket tore from the white base of the room, and the shape of it all began to spiral in, warp—
	“Gabe!” Stu drawled, stepping into the room, “God– what the hell?” and was pulled into the cushions.
	“WHAT!” Naomi spat and–
“Your fault,” Naomi spat as fury distorted her face into a wild sneer.  “Fucking told you.”
 “Oh,” I muttered dumbly, “Right.” That’s not what I remember. 
But my memory fizzle-popped away as Naomi glared at me, freckles snapping brilliantly on her face and dancing along her angel’s cusp to wriggle up her upturned petulant nose. She tugged a pitch black hat down over her face, clenched her teeth and gritted them. “Yeah, oh is fucking right, Gabe.” She looked like she was about to slap me. Holding her breath, she counted to ten, opened her eyes, and resolved herself in a bitter grin. “Come on, Gabe. Let’s get Alyssa and find a way the fuck out of here.”
I frowned. “Alyssa’s here?”
“Yeah,” Naomi spat, and thundered off.
“Is Ren? Stuart?” I paused. “What about the new guy? Is he here?”
“New– what? God Gabe, just– come on!” she cried. “Hurry the fuck up.
I began to rise but felt something sharp under my ass. I frowned down at something still clutched hard in my ice-cold fingertips– it was Ramsey’s book. 
Some dark figure was printed into the cover, but I refused to waste time regarding it nor the golden lettering. I hmphed, shoved it in my pocket, and followed after Naomi.

Alyssa was standing a few paces off, utterly upright as if her head was being pulled up by a fish hook into the universe. Her face was sweat-coated, ashen; green eyeliner wings glinted in the uncanny sun. She stared listlessly into the distance, tremoring, fists ashen and flushed an unnatural swollen red around the pale beds of her palms.  Her lips were gently parted in concentration.
	I walked all around her, frowning. “Alyssa?” I muttered, and she twitched, turned her head.
“Hey, Gabe,” she murmured, and sunlight licked her irises an iridescent sheen, and shot violet sparks into her pupils, “How are you feeling? How’s your jaw?”
“My…?” I touched my jaw. 
A violet glimmering thread sewed my jaw tight, pulled until it ached and–
Frowning slightly, I blinked the hallucinations to mash away. “It’s fine, Alyssa. Are you doing okay?”
She hummed, ignored my question and straightened up even taller. As she moved, the sun flared brighter– the curls of her hair glinted coolly in that off-coloured sun, gleamed like sweet springs in a beautiful tree of swaying movement. She pointed towards a nearby structure. “Let’s go that way,” she said quietly,  “I really think we should.”
Naomi gave me a look. It communicated something like Gabe, what the fuck? I glanced back at Alyssa’s easy smile, swallowed dryly. 
“Why, Alyssa?”
She smiled at me. “Just feels right. Just listen, alright? Not for nothing, you need to learn to start trusting your friends, Gabe.”
That froze something warm in my chest.  “Alright,” I called loudly. “Let’s go. Lead the way.” Naomi glared at me as we followed along.
As we came closer to it it became clear that the structure was man-made; sharp pink angles thrust against the green-blue sky, stabbed that plastic sheen and seemed to bulge it away. As we got closer it became clear that the structure was a commercial building. At the edge of the parking lot, the squiggling pink flooring dwindled away to a few sparse strands; the parking lot spilled over, a brushed bed of crumbled blue gravel with poorly painted white parking spot lines. 
Cars were parked there, but all anchored down— none had wheels, for some odd reason, rusted axles thrust at angles into the chill air. Each car seemed pricey, gorgeous and from the 60’s, but each was off somehow– I couldn’t determine the make or model of a single vehicle for the life of me. The grocery store looked like it was straight out of the 50’s– but its garish coloration matched the sky and grass, which made me somewhat ill. A buzzing sign announced the branding in bright neon streaks. Beyond the building a larger road curved off to what I assumed to be more businesses, perhaps some skyscrapers, and faintly a slope up to some massive mountain peak.
	As the gravel crunched beneath us, I slowed at a car and stared at my reflection for a moment, my own exhausted eyes glaring back with pupils dark and heavy. I touched the gleaming surface and hallucinated the metal into small gleaming whorls under my fingertips.
Naomi’s grip dragged me along and I swore, stumbling to follow as we paced after Alyssa. She stopped abruptly at the glass doors, smiling back at us. 
“Alyssa?” I ventured.
“Go inside,” she said softly, “I’ll come in in a minute.”
	Naomi and I locked eyes again. 
“Alright,” Naomi said gently, “We’ll meet you there.”
	Alyssa smiled, leaned her head towards the building, and off we went.

 All around us were rows and rows of food shelving, oddly angled, crooked and uneven like a bed of mangled teeth gleaming under fluorescent light. The floor was a chequered pink and white tiling and the walls were the same greenish blue as the sky. Here and there, large posters announced goods and sales, but for some reason I couldn’t get a good read on what any individual product was– the fruits were oddly foreign and the labels averted the eye. I was frowning at one such incomprehensible label when Naomi gripped my arm sharply. “Come on,” Naomi said, “we need to–” 
She cut herself off. “What?” I asked. She was staring at the leftmost wall. 
“Stuart?” Naomi mumbled. I blinked and followed her gaze. A broad-shouldered form was perusing the canned goods aisle, hands folded behind his back. The mountain man turned and frowned at us, face flushed, and I almost immediately noticed that something was off. Stuart’s beard was absurdly large– grown out of proportion and out of shape. I stared at a fedora of fine green felt pressed down onto his head, a fine pink suit unpeeled around his rotund form to expose a sharp white undershirt plaid in green lines like laser beams. He was wearing some kind of suit pants; none of which he would ever, ever wear. “Hello, Gabriel, Naomi,” he said in an accent I couldn’t quite identify– it wilted like a dying flower and tinkled coolly with a jingle bell’s chime.  Naomi went rigid, cold beside me.
“Gabriel,” I repeated blankly, pointing at my shirt and prodding it with a finger. “Me? Gabriel?” 
I was about to open my mouth to question him further when a violent pinch on my fingertip locked my jaw. He frowned, and I fixated again on his beard– it was curlier, auburn locks of electrified wire. “Well, yes.” His frown deepened, sharps of his teeth glaring in the overhead white lights. The more I watched him, the more I noticed differences about him– a new mole here, different creases under his eyes. A complexity to his grimace that was never present in him before.“What’s gotten into you today?” he asked with a tinkling of silverware.  I swallowed uncomfortably. “Aren’t you supposed to be watching the game?”
	With a slam, a house of greens and blues and pinks bloomed before my eyes. It was our house, but somehow not– the furniture was just off enough to concern me. It was as if someone had snuck into our house at night and removed every last piece and replaced it with something slightly different, with a new pattern or new dimensions. A skeleton with my hair was sitting before a glowing television which blared light heavily and garishly onto it, where a strangely lilting voice described teams in a game I’d never–
“Gabriel, are you feeling okay?” Stuart asked. I blinked, startled at the hallucination. He leaned over, frowned deeper, and looked at Naomi. “Gabriel’s acting strange, don’t you think, Nai. Can you take him home?”
The skeleton crumpled against the couch, bones snapping and dissolving to a fine powder, and pink fibres encroached to cover the remaining fragments like hungrily snaking vines.
	I squeezed Naomi’s hand, hard, and she said sharply, cold, “Oh, I just don’t know, Stuart, he’s been acting erratic all day. I can take him home if you’d like.” Her voice had taken on that strange, lilting cadence. Fear jolted in my gut. 
I stared at Naomi blankly as everything began to shrink to a point, my world beginning to spin, the walls twisting and distorting into fractals spilling down from the ceiling. Is Naomi betraying me? What the hell’s going on? Then she fixed me with a frigid glare out of the corner of my eye and I understood.  “I don’t know, Stu,” I mumbled, “I’m just feeling a bit off, oh, and hungry–” He gripped my arm, hard, and the force of his fingertips ground boulders into my bones and shut me up. 
“And what are you wearing, Gabriel?” he asked tremendously, and danger rocketed through every corner of my body. “What are you–”
	A crash and a bang. Stu loosened his grip, glanced over his shoulder. “I got it,” Naomi nearly shouted, “I’ll go figure that out. You can stay here, Stuart.” She wrestled me out of his hand. 
With a gentle “Hm,” Stu nodded gently, eyes rolling away and fluttering his fingers into a fist. He turned to stare back into his aisle. 
 I hesitated. Despite my better senses I stared down with him at the items for sale: none of the labels made sense. I tried to read the lettering– but the individual letters, inscribed in off-yellow, were prohibitively wrong, obscurely off. “As I stared at the labels some nauseous climbing swirling rose in my gut, and the letters roiled, began to smear together. And the numbers. Something was wrong with the numbers.
Naomi pulled hard. “I need your help, Gabe!” she shouted loudly, and Stuart huffed, smiled at me. 
“What do you think of this, Gabe?” he said with his gentle metallic tinkle. “Does this look good?” I was trapped as if in honey. The numbers.  I stared at the sequence on a bar code as Stuart lifted a bunch of– oh god, something, who knew because the vegetable wasn’t exactly describable– and the sequence scraped against my mind over and over again– 212, 42, 8, 9, 2783—
 “Come on,” Naomi hissed at me, tearing me along. We hurried along the blue paint, and I felt increasingly calm even as the numbers and letters from the labels curled, curled, curled in my brain. 
As soon as we were out of sight of the Stuart, Naomi glanced back and shoved me aside, pushed me to the wall. I slammed back, the numbers jarring out of my vision– I felt like I was losing something, something big and important–
“Everyone’s acting strange,” Naomi hissed. “Everyone but you. We need to stick together.” I stared at her blankly and this seemed to make her even more distraught. “Stu wasn’t– he was different, Gabe. I don’t know what happened, but that’s not our Stu.” She let out a sharp breath of air, looked around furiously and anxiously, “Alyssa’s acting strange, too– but I had a good look at her. Her face was hers. Her hair was hers. She at least looked like herself.” 
She looked between my eyes. Her eyes were searching, pleading in a way– they flicked between mine rapidly, as if asking, am I normal? they seemed to ask. I’m me, right? Can you tell me that I’m real? Is any of this real? I swallowed uneasily, nodded and pulled up a slight smile. “We stick together. Just the two of us.”
This seemed to reassure her. She smiled slightly before clapping my shoulders. “Right,”  she said sharply, fumbling almost subconsciously in her pocket. “We need to stick together, whatever this is. God, I need a cigarette. Do you– Fuck, you wouldn’t have one. Alright, alright.” She glanced at me again, nodded almost to herself. “Come on. I want to talk to Alyssa.” Halfway through pacing she hesitated. ”You know what, Gabe– maybe we had too strong of a trip or something– did we take anything before this? God, maybe my gloom was laced–”
“No,” I spat before I could stop myself. She looked back, her eyes frozen huge as a deer in headlights. “You know that’s not what this is, Naomi.” She stared at me waveringly, then some feverish light died in her eyes. “This is real.”
I stared at the girl with lakes for eyes and her outstretched hand over a checkerboard floor before a maze of aisles that didn’t make sense. Then I stared into the grocery store, trying to find some end to the shelves, but they seemingly twisted off into infinite– the place was a maze. Naomi pulled my gaze down as she grabbed my hand and I locked my eyes to the floor, letting myself be dragged as I counted the blurring tiles by. 
Gradually, Naomi nodded as we walked. “Thanks for being honest, Gabe.”
“Sure.” I felt a slight smile rise.
We walked on and on, for moments, ages, god–

We were going the wrong way.
I stared at the ceiling lights as we passed and they buzzed, buzzed harder than I could take. In my head I could somehow sense the jaggedy nature of the light– the way the wavelength hummed up and down, jagged up and all around, and I could ride the shape of it in my mind, I felt a strange euphoria– the odd feeling I had when I was reading Stuart’s label was coming back. And it scared me.
“We’re going the wrong way,” I muttered. My throat was dry– I had no idea how long we’d been going.
“What?” Naomi said.  I realised momentarily that she actually hadn’t heard me.
“We’re going the wrong way,” I said more clearly. “We’ve been going deeper into the store.” 
Sweating, Naomi slowed down. Then she slapped her forehead and thanked me, dragging us down another aisle. “God,” she said, “I’m– I’m sorry. I didn’t realise. I got so distracted following the tiles– or, I don’t know, following the turns– something, I lost track of–”
“No,” I muttered, “I get it.” The patterns, I added mentally. It’s the patterns again. She’s feeling it too. 
And we coursed deeper, deeper.
Aisle 234, Aisle 127, 1, 8, 3,
FUCK!
	“That way,” I cried out, and pointed at a break in the shelves through which sunlight was streaming in gently through an arid window. Naomi stopped in her tracks, pulled off that course, and seemed disgruntled, upset at the derailment. As we sped through, I felt myself dissociating again and again– the longer I watched the cans flicker by on the shelves, the more they seemed to flow together into one, steadily rippling stream. And another thing– I couldn’t seem to read a single one. I felt my jaw falling open as Naomi dragged me through that series of aisles felt like a maze, failing to raise my tongue to ask if we’d been here before–
	“God, sorry,” Naomi said, “I don’t know what came over me. Here we are.”
We’d found the entrance again. I spotted the source of the concussive sound almost immediately– just around the corner from where we’d found Stu originally, the front door had been ripped open, hard, and glass from the door had shattered and scattered across the floor, glinting twisted shards of sunlight gleaming hotly on an increasingly temperate day. 
Alyssa stood in the doorway now, grinning wanly, all colour drained from her lips, mumbling incoherently about something and her palms redder than before.  Naomi fixed me with that look again– somehow half-pleading, somehow begging for reassurance– but also somehow, fix this, Gabe! This doesn’t make sense– what did you do? What did you fucking do–
	I stepped closer to Alyssa, subconsciously easing out of Naomi’s line of sight. I caught a tune of her murmurings– a tirade about small numbers and fearful numbers, and numbers that towered higher than the sun, all building up towards one– “Hey, Lyss,” I murmured.
Her lips fell still, and she looked at me gently, turned slightly towards us, sun gleaming to burn a golden gleam against her skin. Like some inner display projector casting I saw a purple glimmer in her eye. “Hey, Gabe. How’s your jaw?”
I frowned at her. Again with that jaw shit? 
“I’m fine,” I repeated. “How are you feeling?”
She smiled, listing slightly in place. “Oh, I’m fine. Doing fine.” She smiled at me again “Feeling great, actually. Really feeling connected with myself, for once.” She looked down at her hands, smiled as she rotated them back and forth. “I feel like me.” Then she looked back up at me. “You feel it too, Gabe, don’t you? Hey, actually– can I take a moment of your time? Can we talk for a minute about the Gibbering Oneness?”
My ears began to ring. Fractals spewed out across the ceiling, spinning and twisting sharp corners to repeat, repeat, recurse. This time, they took on new, vividly rectangular shapes– not the usual– and they hurt, god they hurt to look at. The buzzing in the ceiling lamp built to a point – the patterns in the buzzing were grating, I could feel them running some unnatural current through my skin, horribly zapping but vividly energising. I stared at Alyssa and again I saw that sharp, purple glint– 
“Gibbering oneness?” I mumbled. I stared at that glimmer in her pupil. Then I remembered with a jolt that there were only pinks and blues in the store. There was nothing purple to reflect in her eyes, nothing at all. “I don’t actually have time right now, Alyssa.” I swallowed. “I have to go home. With Naomi. Catch that game.” 
I began to back away from her. I hesitated as she went silent, eyes tremendously sad, but then shook my head to clear it, holding a palm up and dragging Naomi towards the door. “We’ll be back soon, Lyss,” I said. “You can tell us all about it then.” I tried to keep my composure. “Just need a breath of air.”
We got to the doorway, and started to push out of the grocery store. I swore I could feel Alyssa’s smile tick up slightly. “Okay, but don’t take long, Gabe.” she said all singsong and clasped her hands together warmly. “Something big is coming and you won’t want to miss it.”

The sun sweltered down at us, sweat caking my soul.
I pulled Naomi into the outside air, shoved my fingertips into my hair and clenched. I breathed rapidly, nausea ticking up higher and higher. I could sense the patterns in the– 
“God, Naomi,” I croaked, “What the hell is going on?”
	I stared up at the sun, then down at the hungry blue stones. It was getting hot out– ungodly hot. Naomi looked on at me in desperation. “I don’t know. God, Gabe– maybe we really did take too much gloom. Please say we did. Maybe we’re hallucinating this–”
“No, no, that’s not it,” I burst. “This doesn’t— feel— fake. This is real. Right? Look– you remembered coming through the couch– and I’m sure if you ask Alyssa–”
“Fuck!” Naomi cried, and screamed in frustration, pacing the rubble and kicking the ground.
We froze simultaneously as we heard a familiar cry from inside. 
“Ren?” I whispered. 

We stepped back into the store. Stuart was still in the vegetable aisle, hands clasped behind his back. Alyssa smiled at us expectantly. “Back so soon,” she muttered warmly. “But not soon enough.” 
I stared at her. “What does that mean, Alyssa?”
4 5 8 9
“Something came,” she said softly, “and you missed it. Don’t worry, Gabe, I can help you find out what it was. I’m our group’s detective.” As she said the last words, something flickered across her face and she looked exhausted. “I’m– the detective of the group.” Stu angled his head slightly, frowned, then looked back down. Alyssa’s grin returned heavily and energy returned to her. “We’re all apt to be detectives from time to time. That something– it’s down in the back, by the freezers.” 
“Thanks, Alyssa,” I said shakily, dragging Naomi down the way, and we were both moving so fast I couldn’t tell who was dragging who.

A rose petal here, a spiderweb there of ruby beads, and a pile of leaves from deep red autumn were  collecting under my friend.
	“Ren?” I mouthed. They were caked in fiery tones; redness gripped them with an aching claw. I walked up to them and their blue eyes licked up; I stared down as the walls of the place shifted and warped around me, licked by gentle embers. “Oh, God, Ren.” I leaned down, pulled them up, and they hung loose, lax in my arms. They were bleeding everywhere– oozing thick molasses from a hole blown in their side to carve that vibrant display. “What happened to you?” I asked quietly.  Their lips moved slightly, thin soft leaves trembling and teeth gleaming twelve stars. 
I couldn’t hear them. I glanced back towards Alyssa staring down the way, glared towards the mountain man by the vegetable zone. Then I leaned closer. 
“It was Stuart,” they whispered, and I froze as I heard the big man beginning to gently murmur in the distance. “The Gibbering oneness, it made him do it.” They swallowed hard. “You need to get me out here.”
	Naomi had wandered off. As she scampered to the end of the aisle, she watched Stu unclamp his blood splattered hands, swing something from the shelf and start towards us with it in hand. “Ren and I had a little disagreement,” he was mumbling to himself in harsh tinkle tones, “a little altercation.” Naomi’s pupils shrank to a point. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck–
I was staring down at Ren in the shadows as she slammed into view. “We need to get Alyssa and go,” Naomi stammered. 
Then Alyssa began to sing in the distance and my heart started to sink.
	
The buzzing of the lights became a shrill tinkling trill and I screamed silently, gritting my teeth as Naomi clamped a cold hand down over them and numbers passed over my lips in a spilling anthem. Loping Ren down through aisles, I panted heavily, trying my best not to jostle my friend or make the bleeding thicken. 
What is going on?
What is going on?
7 8 14 12 
I muttered numbers endlessly into the sweaty palm, closing my eyes tight and finally forcing my jaw to lock. Shit, I hissed internally, glanced at Naomi and nodded as I ensured it was wired fucking tight. 
She removed her sweaty hand from my lips and I swallowed hard, hurried on in utter silence and slipped Ren down a corridor, cowering deeper into the shadows of the store as my eyes glinted and my tongue flapped uselessly against the locked door of my teeth.
“Just an altercation,” Stuart bellowed with that lilting metallic hum, “Just a little altercation between Ren I we had,”
A self repeating circle in my head budded new circles into itself, and those buds budded cirlces, budding circles, circles and
“Just a little thing– nothing to worry about!” Stuart lilted, crunching a soda can underfoot and swinging the heavy thing in his hands from side to side. “Just a little bit of a dispute about unity, and the value of it. Ren doesn’t like the way we live. He’d like to leave. He doesn’t want to stay the way we live. But you two– you’re all good. You have nothing to worry about. You’re good. You’ll go home and watch TV and see your silly game. And then–”
I looked down at Ren and they smiled wanly, eyes half open, shadowed. What did you get yourself into, buddy?
58 9 6 12 3 4 187 6 2 4 and I met Naomi’s eyes with my own gleaming and nodded sideways at a corridor. She nodded and we lifted Ren again, hurried and hid in an aisle, silently sitting and only Ren’s rasping breaths ricocheting through the air.
	“Just a little altercation!” Stuart bellowed again, this time closer. “Just a little altercation, Naomi! Gabe, you understand.”
Ren was rasping. Feeling terrible, I covered Ren’s little mouth with my hand, feeling spit wet the fibres and closing my eyes as I gave a small gap to breath. And then Alyssa’s song came closer from the other side–
“O’blessed bethe day
“The black grows into steeples 
Sunny o’ my sunshine
When the red vines turn to violet”
My vision swam. I swallowed hard, closing my eyes tight and locking my head back into the shelving. The numbers were blasting in my head, curling and twisting over and over and repeating some goddamned shape– I gripped Naomi’s arm, hard, and she stared at me in shock, tried to twist away. I shook my head, rapidly, gesturing to the empty marlboro box bulging in her pocket next to her eyeliner.
“Blessed is the day
That catabolic numbers
Arrived inside the members
Of oxen and of fields”
I don’t have long, I wrote smudgily in her eyeliner, I’m becoming like them. I’m starting to see whatever the fuck they’re seeing. We need to get out of here, now.”
“And o’er by the prairie 
Did the sheep began to sing
Come by the beloved
Stinging of salivation”
Naomi nodded rapidly, eyes bulging– me, too– we have to go– and gestured a sharp finger up in the distance to what vaguely resembled an emergency exit sign, the letters all twisting that made my mind sing. I closed my eyes tight and took a deep, rattling breath, another, then three, then forced myself up, dragging Ren’s body up with exhaustion. Naomi pulled them up too, and avoiding the sound of Alyssa, we sped towards the doorway.
“JUST AN ALTERCATION!” Stuart bellowed again, and we sped out from under that tone and it faded with reverberations. 
We got closer to Alyssa’s song, which was gentler now–
“Come with Steven Ivory
And dance in his waters
A small monument to
The gibbering oneness”
I skidded to a halt, froze in place. Steven Ivory?  
“Gabe!” Naomi shout-hissed, but I remained frozen in place.
Steven Ivory?
Then a massive form hand swung from around the aisle. Stu walked past our shelf and I ducked quickly, swearing as Ren’s weight deepened in my arms. Fuck fuck fuck.
	A mountain skull rose. Two cold, hard, nearly mechanical eyes roved over the tops of the shelves, and Stuart “Hmmph’d” before staring back down at his hands. “Nothing there, hmm” came that cold murmur.
Naomi caught my eyes and they glinted in the shade of the shelving. She nodded towards the door– the emergency exit was in sight, a glinting glass doorway beckoning through the darkness. I looked back helplessly, indicating Stu’s guard and frustration flickered over her face.
	I looked the other way. The shelving seemed to stretch, twist and spiral in one branching, endless column and overwhelmed I stared down, head spinning.
Suddenly from some unseen speakers played booming jazz and Stuart meandered into our aisle, grinning harshly and dragging something heavy and metallic to gape at us. “Out of my way, Gabe!” he yelled and it was a tremendous boom that rattled me to my bones. 
I saw red– everything coloured red. Ren mumbled something hoarsely and I swore, clutching them tight to me. Naomi yelled hysterically and ripped me out of the way and a concussive blast made my ears burst and reform. I stared through the aisles as Stuart raised his revolver, smoke patterning off towards the ceiling as I watched infinite patterns sprawl from his body and scatter across the room.
“COME ON!” Naomi shouted and dragged me forward by Ren’s weakened legs and I swore, gripping tighter, swinging them and myself forward. We lumbered, faster and faster towards the exit, light burning into my eyes.
