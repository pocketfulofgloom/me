PART IV: A VISITOR LATELY

9 // A VISITOR LATELY
Crimson sunset blazed and the sky poured violet response. 
Bathed in swathes of vividly shifting lights, Stuart wrapped something harsh and red– his meaty yet dextrous fists wrapped snow white bandages tight across red rivers like bridges. Below him, a stranger lay on the couch, arm throbbing intensely, panting raspily with breath hitching, murmuring insanity as he clutched at his gelled black hair with his good hand. 
“What happened, Stu?” I muttered as purple light bled in through the window to gleam in our eyes. 
He stared at me with harsh coal eyes glimmering softly in the moonlight. “Not sure,” Stuart said gruffly, and I heard that man on the couch start to sing feverishly. “Keeps saying something big is coming. Not sure what that means.” He stared out the window for a moment, glaring at the sun, before continuing his work. “But he’s safe here. Anyone who comes here is safe.”
I nodded, crouched beside the singing man, stared at the twisted knotted features, and watched that mouth gasp open. He turned towards me, teeth clenched. “What happened to you?” I mouthed, and his eyes shimmered brightly. I swore in that moment, as sweat licked down my temple, I swore that I knew exactly what had happened. 
I leaned back, blinking, and jarred myself on the carpet, rugburn streaking my elbows. “Excuse me,” I muttered. “I need a moment.”
I lumbured to the bathroom, ran cold water, splashed my face and blinked. I swear to god the sunset carried something special that night– and in time, I’d come to prove that it had. For now, I gazed into my sweating features as the death of day smeared the mirror with strokes of pink-violet paint, threw strange shadows across the hallway and skittered down into blackness.

“I need to tell you a story.”
By nine o’ clock, our visitor had somewhat recovered. 
We were sitting across from him at the dinner table, and my eyelid was twitching, twitching. God– it’s been a while since I’d slept properly, I thought to myself. My gloves pressed into the glinting mahogany as I waited impatiently. Please let this be quick– I just need some goddamned sleep– fingers tapping, tapping, increasing into a thin sharp crescendo–
	“Alright,” Alyssa murmured, glaring daggers at me, and I fell still. “Tell us all about it.”
I smiled wanly. Alyssa was practising extraordinary restraint– we all were, somehow. Even though my irritation was rising, some calm wave kept washing over me– it always did when we had new arrivals at the house at 415 Montgomery. 
Something was wrong today, though. 
I must have been coming down with something.  I’d never felt this kind of upset at new arrivals– and this roiling sense of unease was definitely some type of fever oncoming.
Warmly breaded chicken laid before me, rife with salt and glazed with honey and flecks of baked garlic– usually I knew I’d enjoy it, but right now even looking at it made me feel ill. I glanced at Naomi's seat for sympathy but to my surprise found it empty.
Damn– she gets out of this? I stared at the table cloth until patterns burst from the seams, rippled across it in looping streaks. Must be in her psycho phase.
	“My name is Ramsey,” the visitor said abruptly, drawing my eyes up, “Ramsey Pollard.“ He smiled around at us, guilefully charming– somehow daring us to say otherwise. “And tonight, I’d like to tell you the story of the Gibbering Oneness.”
	Something squirmed in my gut. Bleakly, I stared down at my chicken.  As Ramsey started to speak again, intense nausea rolled up in waves and my stomach churned immensely, twisting itself into a tangled, sickly knot. “I think I need to go to bed,” I said suddenly, voice hoarse. “I’m feeling terribly sick,” and with that pushed out of my chair with a squeal, eased from the table, stumbled down the hall and thumped up the stairs.
Almost there– 
Ren’s bone-dice eyes rattled in the darkness.
I slipped on the carpet and crashed into the corner of my bed. I groaned. Forehead smarting, I dragged myself into the covers, pulled the sheets up to my face, and huddled in, cold sweat rippling down my back. 
I stared into the ceiling, expecting my usual hallucinations, but swore it was churning with small black dancing shadows– like a hundred cat’s tails bending and flicking in some macabre ensemble. The next thing I knew, as the ceiling stretched into the infinite, I faded, faded and began to dream:
Her lips trembled, peeled open; laboured breath hitched and simmered in a mellow drawl. Mucus ran in rivers down the canals of her throat and she rasped, gasping. Alyssa squirmed in bed, eyes bared, glistening wet orbs of jello. Stuart, Ren, Naomi and I stood over her like strange giants, swirling and vibrating and spreading out across the walls and ceiling.. She looked up, lips pale, tongue parched and tried to form words as we hallucinate shifted into black creatures; Ren kept flickering into that horned shape, eyes bone white rolling inky darkness bubbling forth again.
“Something’s wrong,” she tried to say, but not a sound escaped, only a pale, writhing breath. “Help–” she tried again but it only came out as a thin, keeling, almost silent whine. The light glared buzzed like cicadas on an open field and the fever kept drawing hallucinations from her, rolling and crashing and endlessly pushing; silhouetted us into black forms; swirled, swam back.
I opened my mouth to say something but my jaw was locked tight. I turned away for a moment, nauseous, a cold sweat dripping down my back. Ren put a hand on my back, sympathising– but then turned rapidly tugged my sleeve. I stared down. Alyssa’s chest canal had popped open, ribs exposed, and fungal growth was slivering free– small white bulbs unfurled from between her ribs, and out came pink and blue specs of fungal growth that swelled like balloons and then burst open little cups, spreading white specs like pollen through the air.
“Fuck no,” I murmured, turned over, and in another dream–
I rolled my eyes open at a gentle tap. 
“Hey, Gabe,” a voice muttered gently. I found that the stranger from the night before was sitting at my bedside, shadows flitting around like a dozen tiny bugs rippling across his face in a dance of horrifying synchronicity. I blinked and for a moment hallucinated Ren's shadow staring down at me, bone-dice eyes rolling– then forced the hallucinations to smear away. Before me again was just Ramsey’s face– the shadows were still there, refusing to leave, and danced in absurd comma patterns.
“Hey, Ramsey” I said hoarsely, leaning back on my pillow. I coughed harshly–I was definitely coming down with some sort of sickness. “Sorry to be rude, earlier. Usually I like to stay up when we have new arrivals. Good manners, you know?” Gradually I hallucinated them sitting at the dinner table– all of my friends and Ramsey discussing his story. In my hallucinatory fever dream it twisted them into singing angel songs–
“No, no,” he murmured, “it’s alright,” and the hallucination broke. His voice was sleek as a freshly shined Mustang and the glimmering scales on a black mamba’s jaw. 
I finally got a good look at his face. He was oddly pale– a thin sort of pale, with red flush below. His teeth were good natured, nose sculpted, eyebrows slick although his eyes were a bit beady. His hair was done with gentle care– I could see hours of his pale, slim fingers curling through it, just a bit more gel with that lock, slicked to slim perfection.
And his arm. Still it was wrapped in layers upon layers of bandages, bloodstains were clearly visible between cracks in the layers. “Hey, Ramsey,” I muttered, “What happened to your arm?”
He shook his head. “Another time, Gabe– that’s your name, right? Stuart told me, but I’m not the best at remembering. He smiled, passed me a glass of lukewarm water, which I greedily engorged– it was so old that bubbles had bloomed up at the bottom of the glass, but at that moment I didn’t care at all. Still feverish, but less woozy, I leaned back, smiling. “Thanks, Ramsey.”
“Sure,” he said with an easy smile. “I won’t keep you long. I know you need your rest.” He reached out a hand for god knew what reason and at that point I pulled mine from the covers, took it and shook it warmly. He gazed at my glove and surprise registered in his eyes, but he only smiled wider, accepting the fact without question and gently shaking my hand with both hands, which I greatly appreciated. I felt warm around him– I felt safe. Gradually, he retracted his hand, rested it on my comforter. “So– actually, Gabe, the reason I’m here disturbing you is to give you something.”
“Oh?” Despite myself, I was intrigued.
“Oh yes.” Smiling warmly, he slipped a book onto my side desk, patted it. “This tells the story I was going to tell you at dinner.” Intrigued, I glanced at it and some disappointment hit. It was a religious tome– similar in appearance to the book of Mormon, but plastered with some other imagery and golden illumination that I couldn’t discern in the dark and hallucinations. 
“Oh,” I said, smiling forcedly and trying to keep the disappointment out of my voice, “Thanks, Ramsey.”
I felt like he was about to leave and closed my eyes. “Sure thing.” 
A silence. Then there was a rush of chill and he placed a hand backwards over my forehead, frowned at the intensity of the heat. Usually, I would flinch– but something felt ungodly comforting about him that I only sank deeper. “Why, you’re burning up. Try and get some rest, Gabe– I’m sure you’ll feel much better soon.”
“Thanks,” I murmured sluggishly, closing my eyes and feeling only that cool, pale hand, a soft and dovelike shape, flouncing out into a cloud of a white fluff.
“I can tell you the story of him as you drift to sleep?” he murmured, increasingly distant.
“Mmm,” I murmured, and all I felt was that cold, that gentle cold, a perfect sphere, no wrinkles, only a cloud so soft I drifted off into it, merged and melded with the fog and softly, softly, faded into a sort of half-slumber.
“This is the story of the Purple Eaters,” Ramsey murmured hollow, distant, reverberating. 
My vision was blurred. I rubbed my eyes, blinked them open, but even then they failed to focus. In this dream, inexplicably, Ramsey and I were standing in a world of shifting sands. There was a rusted fence ahead of us behind which a perfect black river roiled and swelled. 
Ramsey pointed and I followed his finger to find a shadowed figure crouched in a world of black and white, hands clenched.
“He never remembers this part,” I heard someone say out of sight, a trembling vibrato, bitter. “None of you do, of course, don't worry, I’m not blaming you.”
Ramsey patted my back. “This is the hero of our story– that man by the river.”
	I nodded. The man was staring into that river which flowed to carry white glints upon black currents and grey roaming specs. The fingers of his left hand were scattered across a rusted chain link flickered, clung to it. His other hand clenched a plastic sheathed sheet of paper that had been twist-tied to the fence, crumpled tightly into his fist.
“They say we caused it,” the hero whispered, “The sickness in the city,” and I jolted in surprise. “Everyone complained of it, their illnesses. They said that it was from our chemical waste.”
	Someone said something out of earshot but I couldn’t hear him– I was already speaking. “That’s the hero?” I asked, concerned and a strange terror throbbing in my heart.
Ramsey gripped my shoulder tight. “Pay attention, Gabe. I’m only going to read you this chapter once.”
“Alright.” I watched as a thick, heavy sludge leaked in globs from the processing plant to ooze into the river. The fluid seemed twisted, wrong, spilled through to the water supply. The muck bludgeoned outwards melted; ripples dancing along and spreading across those rapidly rolling waves. An infinite sea of violet bacterium, cilia jagging violently, scuttled through the water like so many shrimps to sea.  
The hero turned to someone standing behind me and murmured that “we caused it all. We did not know what we’d done. Lockjaw spread through the city like a wildfire. The infected screamed that they saw purple, and it grew in blossoms and blooms out of their nostrils, their jaws, and they jittered their teeth together, told of strange truths that the infection whispered to them. 
“It spread through the sclera of their eyes— they ran hot showers and the steam carried it— it spread, climbed in through the pupil, proliferated and grew, filling the mind with purple thoughts that screamed to the men and women of–”
“FOCUS, GABE!” Ramsey shouted, and his grip became painful, harsh,
“-dangerous, strange, whispered things. They would roam the street, gibbering, talking of intrinsically twisted truths that boggled the mind with new mathematics; they were known as the Purple Eaters. It all culminated in a seizing of the body and clenching of the jaw that frothed, spit, trembled. The lilting forms with a creeping kilter crumpled down the street, jittered. Eventually, as we all do, they perished.”
The hero was hunched over, frail, trembling, posture far older than his voice suggested. He blinked and fumbled the packet out of its plastic sheeting, scattered that wad of papers he had clutched in one fist to the air. The pages, ancient and time-worn, dissolved into smaller scraps into the air, rippled through the gaps in the chain link fence to dissolve to melt into the river water. Like chemicals they mixed, swirled into the water.
Seeming ancient, the hero spoke: “Accidents happen. Accidents must be brushed away, washed clean, and swept off in the name of purity, and great success. For every failure, for every crimson blot into the hell of capitalism spilled, spilled, spilled, the failure, the failure, the failure,”
	“That should be enough for now,” Ramsey muttered, turned me away, as the hero muttered “failure, failure” again and again, wobbling eyes fixed into nothing.
We paced away from the scene and into increasing blackness.
“What did any of that mean?” I managed. He patted my back, hummed noncommittal, and increased the pace. 
We began wandering into an infinite darkness and Ramsey’s speed increased and increased; gradually, I found that he had made sizable space between us.
I stopped, and he did too. We stood upon a glassy void, and Ramsey stared strictly. Ahead. “You okay?” I asked gently. His warmth, like that hand on my forehead, drew toward me in waves. He turned back, smiled chillily. “Yeah, Gabe. I’m alright.”
	And the distance stretched between us, stretched, stretched–
	Then the dream was gone.
